# Easy-Automation
###### An in-game script for the game Space Engineers which simplifies the process of manipulation and automation of game blocks.

## Changelog

Current version is *v2.013*.

### v2.013
- The ability to affect one block with an exact name without affecting other similarly named blocks by using # in front of the exact name of the block. Eg: `#block name`.

### v2.010
- ALGEBRA!

Welcome fellow space engineers, to the Easy Automation InGame Script V2.0
Much has changed since the previous version which is why I am releasing this as a new item on the workshop.

## Features

The Easy Automation V2.0 script will allow you to:
- Delay actions to millisecond precision
- Manipulate the Sliders and Actions of every block
- Stop an Automation until a desired situation happens and then resume
- Take a Value from one block and apply it to another
- Rotate a rotor to a desired angle at a desired speed
- Create complex logic which will govern how your automations react to different situations
- Have unlimited LCD code size
- Write and manipulate text on LCD's
- Write current values of blocks to LCD's (such as a pistons "Current position")
- Write to the core LCD the actions and properties of a block you may want to manipulate
- Modify block names (Especially useful when interacting with other tech such as Digi's Control Module)
- Create and destroy specialized groups as well as use the games built in groups (the built in groups can't be created, destroyed or modified with this system)
- Run other programs with arguments you define in your program
- Reset the Easy Automation system in case of a systems failure
- View debug info of a non functioning automation in the detailed info of the Programming block
- Assign simple algebra equations to variables
- Edit the LCD code as the programing block is running it for run time testing/experimenting.

And maybe some other stuff that I can't remember right now, this thing has gotten pretty big!

## Getting started

[I have written up a detailed guide for set up and all available functionality.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685206874)

If you are still having trouble after referring to the guide then ask your questions in the "Questions on Use" discussion on the Steam Workshop.

Good luck fellow Spacefarers and happy Engineering!

**Stable and Development versions** : Both Stable and Dev versions have the same compiler. As far as I can tell it should work in both versions now. Let me know if it doesn't.
