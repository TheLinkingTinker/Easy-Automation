# Easy-Automation
An in-game script for the game Space Engineers which simplifies the process of manipulation and automation of game blocks.


New features since release: 
	v2.010 - ALGEBRA! 
	v2.013 - The ability to affect one block with an exact name without
		 affecting other similarly named blocks by using # in front
		 of the exact name of the block. Eg #block name 


Current Version from this subscription = 2.013 

Welcome fellow space engineers, to the Easy Automation InGame Script V2.0 
Much has changed since the previous version which is why I am releasing this as a new item on the workshop. 

The Easy Automation V2.0 script will allow you to: 
-Delay actions to millisecond precision 
-Manipulate the Sliders and Actions of every block 
-Stop an Automation until a desired situation happens and then resume 
-Take a Value from one block and apply it to another 
-Rotate a rotor to a desired angle at a desired speed 
-Create complex logic which will govern how your automation’s react to different situations 
-Have unlimited LCD code size 
-Write and manipulate text on LCD's 
-Write current values of blocks to LCD's (such as a pistons "Current position") 
-Write to the core LCD the actions and properties of a block you may want to manipulate 
-Modify block names (Especially useful when interacting with other tech such as Digi's Control Module) 
-Create and destroy specialized groups as well as use the games built in groups (the built in groups can't be created, destroyed or modified with this system) 
-Run other programs with arguments you define in your program 
-Reset the Easy Automation system in case of a systems failure
-View debug info of a non functioning automation in the detailed info of the Programming block 
-Assign simple algebra equations to variables 
-Edit the LCD code as the programing block is running it for run time testing/experimenting. 
-And maybe some other stuff that I can't remember right now, this thing has gotten pretty big!

I have written up a detailed guide for set up and all available functionality here:

If you are still having trouble after referring to the guide then ask your questions in the "Questions on Use" discussion below or in the discussion you will find below the guide. 

Good luck fellow Spacefarers and happy Engineering! 

Aug 18th -- I have updated this script now that both the Stable version and the Dev version have the same compiler. As far as I can tell it should work in both versions now. Let me know if it doesn't.
